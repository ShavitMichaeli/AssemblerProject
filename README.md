# AssemblerProject
This project has been made by me and my friend throgh academic course.
We've made an Assembler with specific instructions using the C programing language in C89 standard.
This project has few wierd bugs, that we've noticed before but although those bugs, iv'e decided to upload it anyway and keep working on those bug with time. :)

It was a very challenging and complexed but also very fun project to work on :).

Thanks Barrel for being the best workmate of them all :)

Untill next time :)
